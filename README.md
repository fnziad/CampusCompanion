\***\*CampusCompanion\*\*** is a full-stack web application built to empower BRAC University students by connecting academics, career building, and peer collaboration into a single clean platform. Designed as a Software Engineering course project, CampusCompanion emphasizes a strict MVC architecture, practical functionality, and a modern, soothing user experience.

The platform allows students to explore a curated Course Hub filled with resources like lecture notes, slides, quizzes, and practice materials. It includes a Resume/CV Maker that lets students easily build professional resumes using LaTeX templates, live preview their changes, and share their resume links for job and research opportunities. With the Flashcard/Notes Maker, users can transform their lecture slides or notes into study-ready flashcards for effective studying.

CampusCompanion also features a Job and Research Opportunities section where students can browse, apply, and save postings for internships, jobs, and academic research. In the Student Collaboration Hub, students can form thesis groups, create study circles, join research teams, or post small freelance tasks to collaborate easily across campus.

Currently work in progress using a MERN stack with a simulated JSON database for simplicity, CampusCompanion maintains a professional light mode and a futuristic neon dark mode aesthetic. The platform is role-based, differentiating between general viewers, contributors, moderators, and a single Super Admin, offering full control without the complexity of production-grade authentication.

CampusCompanion is a project about building the student ecosystem â€” organized, effortless, and a little futuristic. Clean code, clean design, and a platform that feels like a lounge where knowledge flows smoothly.
